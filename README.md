# EGB220-A10
General repository for CAD designs, meeting docs, planners and code

## Purpose of githb in our project
Github provides a single space for our project's development, documents, CAD files, code and so forth. This means when we finish the assignment we can make it public and thus advertise our work, this is particularly good for striking an internship.

## What is the directory structure?
The initial version of this github repository has several directories that contain relevant readmes similar to this one you are reading right now, they give an example of what goes into that directory.

## Why is this directory private?
It doesn't need to be for the sake of this assignment, but privacy throughout the development lifecycle is good, it avoids copy cats from other teams and ensures our code remains our property until the conclusion of the assignment.

## Next steps.
I emplore you to change this github repo in the coming days/weeks to fit our needs, I only made this repository to give a structured initial starting point, where we can adapt it to our needs.
